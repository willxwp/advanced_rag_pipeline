We’re also engaging with individuals on climate and other \\nenvironmental topics via YouTube. On Earth Day 2022, \\nwe launched a Non-Fungible Planet campaign, where we \\nteamed up with environmental non-profits, creators, and \\nother organizations to show what makes Earth so special \\nand worth protecting. They journeyed to one-of-a-kind \\nlocales and created videos to highlight the stress our \\nenvironment is under and what we can do to help. In 2022, \\nYouTube also held our first ever Creators for Climate Action \\nsummits, one in New York and one with TED Countdown  \\nin London. To stay safe during extreme weather events, people often \\nturn to the internet with questions. For example, global \\nsearch interest in \\n  “heat waves”   reached an all-time \\nhigh in July 2022. 44 To surface authoritative and helpful \\ninformation in these moments, we’re providing information \\nthrough Search alerts on flooding , wildfire boundaries, and \\nextreme heat. More details on how AI enables these alerts \\ncan be found in the Working together section. Recycling points\\nPeople recognize that recycling plays a crucial role in \\npreserving the future of our planet; global searches for  \\n   “recycling”   are the highest of any sustainability action. 45 \\nIn 2021, we launched a new feature that makes it easier for \\npeople to find nearby recycling points on Search and Maps. In addition to providing information on recycling depots \\nand waste transfer stations, we’re also helping small \\nbusinesses share when they offer in-store recycling. By \\nadding the new recycling attribute to Business Profiles on \\nSearch and Maps, local storefronts and shops can show  \\nthe recycling services they offer in just a few clicks—\\nwhether it’s for plastic bottles, packaging, or electronics. Pre-owned items\\nGlobal search interest in    “slow fashion”   reached  \\na 15-year high in 2022. 46 And global searches for  \\n   “thrifting”   have nearly tripled over the most recent \\nthree-year period compared to the previous three-year \\nperiod,\\n\\u200947 reaching a 15-year high in 2022. 48 The apparel \\nindustry is responsible for nearly 7% of global carbon \\nemissions, so clothing choices have a big impact on \\nreducing both waste and emissions. 49 \\nBuying pre-owned items is a small action people can \\ntake to live more sustainably. In 2022, we launched \\nenhancements to the Google Shopping experience in  \\nthe United States for pre-owned products, such as used \\nand refurbished products. The journey \\nahead\\nWhile a single individual’s actions may seem small, when \\nbillions of people have the tools to make more sustainable \\ndecisions, they add up to have a meaningful impact on \\ntheir communities and the entire planet.

The comments state our support for regular and consistent reporting of climate-\\nrelated matters; note that investors need consistent, comparable, and reliable information on \\nthe material risks and impacts of climate-related events and transition activities on a registrant’s \\nconsolidated financial position; and provide guiding principles and recommendations for the SEC \\nto consider as it designs a final rule. U.S. Federal \\nEnergy Regulatory \\nCommission \\ncomments on \\nimproving generator \\ninterconnection\\nGoogle filed comments (initial and reply) in Improvements to Generator Interconnection \\nProcedures and Agreements (interconnection) Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. Our comments \\nemphasize the importance of reforms that allow independent power producers to continue \\nto thrive and deploy new clean energy resources to meet customer demand. In particular, we \\nadvocate for greater transparency in non-RTO (Regional Transmission Organization) regions \\nand penalties for delays to interconnection studies. U.S. Department of \\nEnergy comments \\non Clean Hydrogen \\nProduction Standard\\nGoogle filed comments on the Clean Hydrogen Production Standard draft guidance. In \\nparticular, we highlighted the need for strong quality criteria—hourly temporal correlation, \\ngeographic correlation, and additionality—to ensure that grid-based clean hydrogen is \\nproduced using clean electricity. Engagement with coalitions and sustainability initiatives\\nSupporting the U.S. State Department’s \\nClean Energy Demand \\nInitiative (CEDI)\\nGoogle.org provided a philanthropic grant to support the establishment of the Secretariat of \\nthe U.S. State Department’s Clean Energy Demand Initiative within the Clean Energy Buyers \\nAssociation. CEDI is an initiative led by the U.S. government that aims to connect countries with \\ncompanies seeking to rapidly deploy clean energy, enabling companies to send demand signals \\nfor clean energy and advance policy measures that enable corporate clean energy procurement. Electricity customer \\ncoalitions\\nTogether with business partners, Google helped launch three trade groups and campaigns  \\nto support the creation of customer-centric wholesale electricity markets across the  \\nUnited States, with the goal of enabling rapid decarbonization of electricity grids while  \\nreducing costs. These include Western Freedom, Coalition for Energy Market Reform,  \\nand Electricity Customers Alliance . U.S. state engagement\\nUtility regulation Google intervened in over 30 regulatory dockets across the United States with coalition \\npartners to promote the cost-effective adoption of clean energy resources. Regulatory \\nframeworks for \\ndecarbonization\\nGoogle led discussions with the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners and \\nthe National Association of State Energy Officials to discuss how Google’s 24/7 CFE goal can be \\na supportive framework to drive cost-effective grid decarbonization. 81\\n2023 Environmental Report  \\nEurope\\nEngagement on European sustainability, climate, and energy policy\\nEnergy Efficiency \\nDirective\\nGoogle engaged with EU policy makers through Digital Europe to inform the development of \\na standardized energy and sustainability reporting framework for data centers, and establish \\nmeasures to encourage greater reuse of waste heat.

Since Google was founded, our efforts to mitigate climate \\nchange have started with our own operations, and we’ve \\nworked hard to lead by example with the ultimate goal \\nof driving larger systemic change. In our third decade \\nof climate action, we’ll continue to take a science-based \\napproach to our efforts, while sharing our own lessons \\nand progress with others. I joined Google eight years ago to lead our sustainability \\nefforts, and have witnessed our sense of urgency and \\nambition firsthand. We’re empowering individuals, \\ngovernments, businesses, and other organizations to \\nmake decisions that can drive positive action for people \\nand our planet. The opportunity we have through our products and \\nplatforms is reflected in our updated environmental \\nsustainability strategy, which focuses on where we can \\nmake the most significant positive impact. Our work \\nis organized around three key pillars: empowering \\nindividuals to take action, working together with \\nour partners and customers, and operating our \\nbusiness\\xa0sustainably. In 2022, we reached our goal to help 1 billion people \\nmake more sustainable choices through our products. We achieved this by offering sustainability features like \\neco-friendly routing in Google Maps, energy efficiency \\nfeatures in Google Nest thermostats, and carbon \\nemissions information in Google Flights. Looking ahead, \\nour aspiration is to help individuals, cities, and other \\npartners collectively reduce 1 gigaton of their carbon \\nequivalent emissions annually by 2030. 2\\nAfter two years of condensed reporting, we’re sharing a \\ndeeper dive into our approach in one place in our 2023 \\nEnvironmental Report. In 2022, we continued to make \\nmeasurable progress in many key ways, such as:\\n• We enhanced and launched new sustainability\\nproduct features, such as eco-friendly routing in\\nMaps, which is estimated to have helped prevent\\nmore than 1.2 million metric tons of carbon emissions\\nfrom launch through 2022—equivalent to taking\\napproximately 250,000 fuel-based cars off the road\\nfor a year. 3\\n• We expanded the availability of Google Earth\\nEngine—which provides access to reliable, up-to-\\ndate insights on how our planet is changing—to\\ninclude businesses and governments worldwide as an\\nenterprise-grade service through Google Cloud. • We opened our new Bay View campus, which is\\nall-electric, net water-positive, restores over 17 acres\\nof high-value nature, and incorporates the leading\\nprinciples of circular design. • We signed 20 more renewable energy agreements,\\nbringing our total to more than 80 agreements\\ntotaling approximately 10 GW of clean energy\\ngeneration capacity—we estimate we’ll spend\\napproximately $10 billion to purchase clean energy\\nthrough 2040. 4\\nWe expect this new era of technological innovation to \\nopen up even greater opportunities to accelerate system-\\nlevel change.\\n\\nBusiness strategy\\nC15.

We work on getting environmental information \\non the world’s forests, fisheries, watersheds, and air into the \\nhands of decision-makers, in support of our aims to both \\naddress a key need for informed decision-making, and to \\nsupport efforts to scale models and solutions that make \\nwater resource information visible and actionable. Google.org has also awarded millions of dollars in grants  \\nto promising water stewardship solutions, including:\\n • BlueConduit, to develop publicly accessible tools \\nto quantify and map hazardous lead service lines \\nfor vulnerable communities, a critical first step to \\nreplacing unsafe water infrastructure. • Global Water Watch, which aims to democratize \\ninformation on water resources.\\n\\nWe actively \\nengage with our stakeholders (e.g., employees, NGOs, \\npolicymakers, customers, researchers, academics, \\nand investors) throughout the year on a broad range of \\nenvironmental topics. Our engagement enables us to better understand \\nour stakeholders’ perspectives, elaborate on our \\nenvironmental strategy, and progress against key targets, \\nand it creates a vital two-way dialogue that informs our \\napproach to the work. See below for more information on how we engage \\nwith employees, suppliers, policymakers, and partners. For additional information on how we collaborate with \\ncustomers, researchers, academics, and NGOs, see the \\nWorking together section. Employee \\nengagement\\nSustainability is part of our culture, and we give our \\nemployees opportunities to engage on environmental \\nissues and put their passions into practice. To celebrate Earth Day, we host an annual virtual event \\nfor employees to learn more about what Google is doing \\nto empower people to make more sustainable choices, \\nsupport our partners and customers, and operate our \\nbusiness more sustainably. Throughout the year, we \\ninvite thought leaders and experts to speak about the \\nlatest sustainability trends, and we post some of these \\ntalks publicly on our Talks at Google YouTube channel. Employees can also access online sustainability courses \\nand can join global and local internal community groups \\nfocused on sustainability topics. Some employees \\nalso take on a 20% project—an opportunity to work \\non something outside of their primary role—related \\nto sustainability. One great example of this is Project \\nSunroof, which began as a 20% project back in 2015. Lastly, employees have the opportunity to learn about \\nsustainability through internal newsletters and education \\ncampaigns. Supplier \\nengagement\\nThrough our supplier responsibility  program, we’re \\nworking to build an energy-efficient, low-carbon, \\ncircular supply chain that makes smart use of the Earth’s \\nresources, protects ecosystems, and helps to combat \\nclimate change. We focus on the areas where we can \\nmake an immediate and lasting impact, such as helping \\nour suppliers improve their environmental performance \\nand integrate inclusivity, climate resilience, water \\nstewardship, and circular design into our supply chain. We believe these principles can play a key role in reducing \\nenvironmental impact and protecting human rights and \\ncommunity health. Google’s Supplier Code of Conduct includes requirements \\nthat enable us to ensure that those we partner with are \\nresponsible environmental stewards. Along with having \\nsuppliers evaluate their operations, we perform our own \\nongoing due diligence and audits to verify compliance and \\nto understand our supply chain’s current and potential risks. When we find that a supplier isn’t complying, we expect \\nthat supplier to provide a corrective action plan (CAP) that \\noutlines the root cause of the finding, how and when that \\ncompany will resolve the issue, and what steps it will take \\nto prevent recurrence. We determine whether the plan is \\nacceptable based on the severity of the noncompliance \\nand the effort and time required to resolve the issue. We expect suppliers to demonstrate improvements to \\ncontinue working with us. Our goal is to resolve the most \\nsevere issues immediately. We expect all other findings to \\nbe resolved in accordance with our guidelines as quickly \\nas is practical. While we work with our suppliers to help \\nthem address our findings, in some instances, we may \\ndecide to no longer pursue a relationship or to terminate \\nour current relationship. In 2022, we audited a subset of our suppliers to verify \\ncompliance for the following environmental criteria: \\nimplementation of environmental management \\nsystems, environmental permits and reporting, product \\ncontent restrictions, and resource efficiency, as well as \\nmanagement of hazardous substances, wastewater,  \\nsolid waste, and air emissions. Googlers chat among indoor plants at our Pier 57 office in New York City. 79\\n2023 Environmental Report  \\nPublic policy and advocacy\\nWe know that strong public policy action is critical to \\ncreating prosperous, equitable, and resilient low-carbon \\neconomies around the world. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \\nChange (UNFCCC)’s 2015 Paris Agreement states that \\nhumanity must “keep global temperature rise this century \\nwell below 2°C above pre-industrial levels.”\\n\\u2009143 Google \\nremains unwavering in our commitment to the Paris \\nAgreement, because climate scientists are clear: we have \\nuntil 2030 to chart a sustainable course for our planet, or \\nwe’ll face the worst consequences of climate change. 144 \\nIn 2022, we saw major steps forward on climate policy in \\nthe United States, Europe, and other regions. New policy \\nmeasures and corporate commitments will continue to play \\nan important role in driving emissions reductions in the next \\ndecade. See Figure 26 for our position on climate policy. FIGURE 26\\nOur position on climate policy\\nAt Google, we support public policies that:\\n• Strengthen global climate action efforts through the Paris Agreement, G20, and other multilateral\\nforums to enhance international cooperation on climate. • Establish emissions reduction targets and technology-neutral pathways  to achieve a low-carbon\\neconomy in line with the IPCC’s guidance and scientific consensus.\\n\\nThe threat is now \\nmore immediate, but the world is also taking action—from \\ngovernmental policy and technology innovation to actions \\nby individuals and organizations—driven by a broader \\nawareness of the danger. I worked on Search for 20 years, leading the product for \\nmany of those, and learned a lot about the unique impact \\nGoogle can have on the world. I’ve always been proud \\nof Google’s leadership in pushing the boundaries of \\nsustainability in our data centers, including achieving carbon \\nneutrality in 2007 (at the time, such accomplishments were \\nuncommon). Going further, we’ve matched 100% of our \\nglobal electricity use with renewable energy purchases for \\nthe last six years—a goal that seemed almost crazy when \\nwe set it in 2012. Today our ambitions have evolved—we now have a bold \\ngoal to achieve net-zero emissions across all of our \\noperations and value chain, and as part of that goal, to \\nrun on 24/7 carbon-free energy on every grid where we \\noperate. The path to get to these goals is difficult, and we’re \\ncommitted to working through the challenges we face with \\nthe ultimate aim of driving larger systems change to create \\na more sustainable future. Further, predicting the future \\ngrowth of energy use and emissions from AI compute in our \\ndata centers is difficult. Despite this, we remain focused on \\ndeveloping new ways to make AI computing more efficient \\nwhile leveraging the opportunities that AI presents to have \\na positive environmental impact. Beyond our own footprint, Google’s founding mission—\\n“Organize the world’s information and make it universally \\naccessible and useful”—can play a very important role in \\naccelerating progress in climate information and action. A sustainable future will be built upon billions of decisions \\nmade by governments, organizations, and individuals, \\nwhich will need to be grounded in good information. Increasingly, we see through Google Trends that more \\nand more people are looking for ways to live sustainably. I believe that we have many strengths and capabilities in \\nproviding quality information that people are seeking to \\nmake decisions that’ll drive positive action for our planet. Helpful information can be critical in both efforts to reduce \\nemissions as well as adapt to extreme climate events like \\nfloods, wildfires, and heat waves. But this information often \\nlives in silos and is hard to access. Making the information \\naccessible and useful can be a tough technical challenge. Our products like Environmental Insights Explorer, Earth \\nEngine, and Data Commons are key solutions to support \\nthe decisions that cities and organizations will have to \\nmake. Information can also have a significant impact \\non the decisions of individuals—particularly in the areas \\nof home energy and transportation. Our products like \\nMaps, Search, and Nest reach billions of users around the \\nworld, and we’re building many features to respond to the \\ndemand for that information in our products. Given the scale of the problem, innovation will also be \\nkey to getting us to a better future. In order to push the \\nfrontiers of innovation, Google has long had a world-class \\nresearch organization that’s been at the forefront of AI and \\nmachine learning. These solutions can help in predicting \\nmore extreme weather (flood forecasting, for instance), \\noptimizing systems from traffic lights to car routes, and \\nmitigating climate change in new ways, for example. In our 2023 Environmental Report, we’re highlighting how \\nthese themes of information and innovation run through \\nmuch of our work:\\nFor information, we’ll feature Google Trends \\ninsights alongside key initiatives to show \\nhow our work is informed by societal trends \\nand\\xa0expectations. And for innovation, we’ll call out the many  \\nplaces where AI is helping to break down  \\nbarriers and advance our work. Over my tenure at Google, I’ve seen how we’ve been \\nworking to integrate sustainability into our work. This \\ntransition is going to be challenging—both for us and for \\nthe world at large—and there’s no playbook for making \\nit happen. But we see our efforts as part of a bigger \\npicture, setting our goals to help scale global solutions, \\nand I’m optimistic that we can, through our efforts in both \\ninformation and innovation, play a helpful role in building a \\nmore sustainable and resilient future.

The accessibility of LLMs has also increased, with many of these models now available for public use, promoting innovation and collaboration across industries. [...] Initially, it was only the leading tech giants such as Google, Microsoft, and Facebook who had the necessary resources to conceptualize, construct, and launch massive models like GPT-4, which boasted an astonishing trillion parameters. OpenAI was at the forefront in this arena, releasing an incredibly useful language model (LLM) that catered to a wide range of applications. However, the year 2023 marked a turning point as other organizations such as Anthropic, Mistral, Google, Meta, EleutherAI, [...] In summary, the AI landscape in 2023 is centered around the remarkable progress of LLMs. From their initial predictive capabilities to their democratization on personal devices, LLMs have revolutionized the way we interact with AI.
